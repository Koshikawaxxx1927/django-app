This is a leaning words app. You can use this app to study something new. To create your own words list to learn, you can add a word and a sentence which means the word.
You will be able to add more words and make the best flashcard which suits you.

## How to use this?

1. Please signin to create your account and login.
2. Please open the menu by tapping the right top button.
3. Select a edit button and add a word list and add a word you want to learn in the list.
4. You can finally study words you added before.
